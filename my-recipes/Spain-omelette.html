      <li>Add the cut potatoes and leave to cook for approximately twenty to thirty minutes over a low heat.</li>
      <li>Once the potatoes are brown, drain them and put them to the bowl with the eggs.</li>
      <li>Heat olive oil in another frying pan and add the onion pieces. Fry until golden brown in colour, caramelised but not
      burnt. The onion will be done before the potatoes, so drain and add to the bowl with the beaten egg.</li>

      <li>Finally we turn it over with a large plate and let it heat up on the other side.</li>
